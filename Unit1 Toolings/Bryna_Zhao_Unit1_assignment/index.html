            <h1>Box Sizing</h1>

                <p>The box-sizing property can make building CSS layouts easier and a lot more intuitive. It's such a boon for
                    developers that here at CSS-Tricks we observe International Box-Sizing Awareness Day in February.
                    <br>But, how is it so helpful and beloved that it deserves its own internet holiday? Time for a little bit
                    of CSS history.</p>

                <h2>Box Model History</h2>
                <p>Since the dawn of CSS, the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-css-box-model/">box model</a> has worked like
                    this by default:</p>
                <p>width + padding + border = actual visible/rendered width of an element's box</p>
                <p>height + padding + border = actual visible/rendered height of an element's box</p>
                <p>This can be a little counter-intuitive, since the width and height you set for an element both go out the
                    window as soon as you start adding padding and borders to the element.</p>
                <p>Back in the old days of web design, early versions of Internet Explorer ( &lt;=I E6) handled the box model
                    differently when it was in "quirks mode". The "quirks" box model worked like this: width=actual visible/rendered
                    width of an element 's box height = actual visible/rendered height of an element's box The border and
                    padding values were moved inside the element 's box, cutting into the width/height of the box rather
                    than expanding it.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/widthbox.png" alt="" title="widthbox" width="367" height="604">
                    <br />
                    <figcaption>The box at the top shows the default box model. The box at the bottom shows what was once the "quirks
                        mode" interpretation of the box model.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Some people preferred this "quirky" interpretation of the box model and considered it more intuitive. It's
                    a valid point. Having the actual visible width of a box turn out differently from what you declared in
                    the CSS is a bit mind bending. </p>
                <p>But, in the days of fixed-width design, it wasn't particularly complicated to work with the default box model
                    once you understood it. You could do a bit of arithmetic to figure out how many pixels you needed to
                    trim off of an element's declared width or height to accommodate its padding and border. The problem
                    for present-day developers is that those absolute pixel lengths don't translate to responsive design,
                    so the same math doesn't apply anymore.</p>
                <p>As responsive design (or, as it was once known, "fluid" or "liquid" layout) started to gain popularity, developers
                    and designers wished for an update to the box model. The great designer <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/">Jon Hicks</a>,
                    known for his excellent fluid width designs, had this to say on the subject in the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-wishlist/">CSS Wishlist</a>                    we put together in 2008:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I would love a different box model! I find it bizarre that padding and border add the width of an object,
                        and would love to be able to give something like a textarea 100% width and 3px padding without worrying
                        what itâ€™s going to do the layout. Perhaps something like padding-inside as a new selector?</p>
                    <p>In that vein I also wish I could specify a 100% width for an element, minus a set fixed width. Again,
                        very useful when creating fluid designs with form elements!</p>
                </blockquote>
                <h3>Present-Day <code>box-sizing</code></h3>
                <p>Those wishes were granted when the <code>box-sizing</code> property was introduced in CSS3. Though
                    <code>box-sizing</code> has three possible values (<code>content-box</code>, <code>padding-box</code>,
                    and <code>border-box</code>), the most popular value is <code>border-box</code>.</p>
                <p>Today, the current versions of all browsers use the original "width or height + padding + border = actual
                    width or height" box model. With <code>box-sizing: border-box;</code>, we can change the box model to
                    what was once the "quirky" way, where an element's specified width and height aren't affected by padding
                    or borders. This has proven so useful in responsive design that it's found its way into reset styles.</p>
                <p>At this point you may be asking yourself, "Is it possible that Old IE did something right?" <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/p/the-revenge-of-the-ie-box-model">Plenty of people think so</a>.</p>
